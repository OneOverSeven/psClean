psClean
=======

Python library for cleaning, disambiguating, and formatting inventors in the PATSTAT patent data file. 

[PATSTAT](http://www.epo.org/searching/subscription/raw/product-14-24.html) provides multicountry patent data files. However, the inventor and patent owner data requires significant cleaning and disambiguation. psClean will provide open source tools for doing so, together with accuracy estimates. 

This work is part of a broader project, funded in part by the European Union FP7 Programme.
