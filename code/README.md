Introduction
---------------

This directory contains the routines to extract, clean, and disambiguate inventor data in the PATSTAT database. 


Order of operations
-------------------

`psCleanup` assumes that you have PATSTAT loaded into a SQL database. The **sql** folder provides the scripts used to create and load tables for the October 2011 PATSTAT release. It may or may not work for future releases, depending on changes applied by the European Patent Office.  

We assume the following order of operations:

1. `./extract/extract_patstat_data.py`
Queries the PATSTAT SQL database for inventors and inventor characteristics; performs preliminary cleaning and standardization.

2. `./clean/prepare_dedupe_input.py`
Formats extracted PATSTAT data for use in the dedupe process.

3. `./dedupe/generate_bash_dedupe.py > eu27_dedupe_script.sh`
`generate_bash_dedupe` produces a bash script that will run
sequentially through all desired countries. See the file itself for
documentation. Running the resulting bash script will disambiguate all
supplied countries.

4. `./postprocess/generate_bash_postprocesss > eu27_postprocess_script.sh` 
`generate_bash_postprocess` will read in a list of output files and
generate a bash script to merge in both the HAN and Leuven data for
subsequent calculation of precision-recall values. See the
`map_dedupe_han_leuven.py` script for documentation. The script
assumes the presence of a SQL database containing the HAN and Leuven
data in specific form.

5. `./analyze/compute_precision_recall.py`
Computes the precision and recall data for each country file and returns useful tables.

Note that the present configuration of `psCleanup` does not write back
into the SQL database; this is a relic of debugging and should be
fixed in the future. Users should make sure that file paths and other
details correspond to their system's file structure.



Dependencies
--------------------

All code here has been tested on a Linux system (specifically
Ubuntu 10.04 or higher). We make no promises about how the default
configurations will work in other environments. 

### Python dependencies
#### Universal dependencies
- pandas
- numpy

#### Data extract dependencies
- MySQLdb
- iPython v0.13 or higher (for parallelization of cleaning on
multi-core machines)
- fuzzygeo, for geocoding. See https://github.com/markhuberty/fuzzygeo
for more detail. 

#### Data cleaning and formatting dependencies
- unidecode

#### Disambiguation dependencies
- [dedupe](https://github.com/open-city/dedupe) and its dependencies. 
- MySQLdb

Note that **dedupe** is still under active development. The code supplied here works as of mid-June 2013. Users are advised to check the commit logs to determine what, if any, changes occurred thereafter. 

### Other dependencies

The plotting and statistical analysis scripts assume you have a recent [R](http://r-project.org) installation. Additional R packages are also required:

- [plyr](http://plyr.had.co.nz/)
- [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/)
- [reshape](http://had.co.nz/reshape/)
- [xtable](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/index.html)

Data
---------------
The raw PATSTAT data can be obtained from the European Patent Office. Data for the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL) can be obtained from the [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ets/). 
We make use of the following data:

- PATSTAT: `person_name`, `person_address`, `person_id`, `person_ctry_code`, `ipc_class_symbol`, `appln_id`, `appln_filing_date`

- Leuven: `person_id`, `hrm_level`, `hrm_l2_id`, `person_name`, `person_ctry_code`

The KU Leuven [harmonized names data](http://www.ecoom.be/en/EEE-PPAT) builds on HAN with additional automated and manual disambiguation. We use the KU-Leuven hand-disambiguated data as a comparison set for computing precision and recall data for our methods. 

- HAN: `HAN_ID`, `OCT11_Person_id`, `Person_name_clean`, `Person_ctry_code`

The OECD Harmonized Applicants' Name ([HAN](http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/oecdpatentdatabases.htm)) database contains supplemental tables for PATSTAT which attempt a straightforward machine-based disambiguation.

- CITL: `accountholder`, 

The [Community Independent Transaction Log](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ets/) reports regulated firms under the European Emissions Trading Scheme. We match our unique PATSTAT inventors to regulated CITL firms. 

- Amadeus

The [Amadeus](https://amadeus.bvdinfo.com/version-2013617/home.serv?product=amadeusneo) database provides financial and corporate structure data for many European firms. We match Amadeus firm data to both PATSTAT and CITL. 


Other logic
------------------------

We ultimately produce a PATSTAT-Amadeus-CITL lookup table. Two additional directories contain the logic used to do so.

- The `citl` folder contains all logic used to match CITL inventors to the Amadeus database

- The `amadeus` folder contains all logic used to match PATSTAT unique inventors to the Amadeus financial database
